 * This is a sentence.  Two spaces between sentences

 * spacing is preferable to discarding it.
 * At the end of a line, we have to make a guess.
 * That is undesirable, but a person can edit the
 * comment to prevent sentences from ending at the
 * end of a line.  Or, there could be a command-line
 * option to control how much space to add
 * after a line-ending period.
